          Hi! I'm Arib. I'm 21 cycles old (as of Jan 10). I'm currently studying
          computer science at the University of Maryland, and I hope to graduate
          with a bachelor's degree by 2024. I love coding, and in my free time,
          I like learning new technologies and working on personal projects such
          as this one! When I'm not coding, I'm either watching sci-fi
          shows/movies or playing video games.
